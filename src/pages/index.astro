			<h1>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my blog. I share my thoughts on how to build quality software, with
				an emphasis on software design and architecture. By laying out my thoughts and 
				ideas, I intend to establish a set of standard rules that will guide me in developing
				maintainable software. I hope you benefit from my writings! Feel free to share your own 
				insights and knowledge. I'm eager to learn from you as well!
